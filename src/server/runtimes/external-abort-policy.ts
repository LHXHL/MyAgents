/**
 * Pure decision for how the external-runtime `session_complete` handler should
 * treat an *error*-subtype terminal event. See external-session.ts.
 *
 * Three outcomes, in priority order:
 *  - `ignore-idle`        — the persistent process died BETWEEN turns (a turn already
 *                           completed and produced no pending assistant text). Common on
 *                           Codex after long idle (SIGKILL exit 137). The next
 *                           send transparently respawns; the user never needed an error.
 *  - `suppress-user-stop` — #307: WE asked the process to stop (user pressed Stop, a
 *                           config-change restart, or a session takeover called
 *                           stopExternalSession). The kill makes the subprocess emit an
 *                           error session_complete, but an abort we initiated is not a
 *                           real failure. Suppress the banner — mirrors the builtin
 *                           path's isAbortedTerminalReason()/isInterruptingResponse gate.
 *  - `surface`            — a genuine runtime failure mid-turn. Show it.
 *
 * Functional Core / Imperative Shell: the shell reads-and-clears the stop flag and
 * performs the broadcasts; this only decides which path to take.
