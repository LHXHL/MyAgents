// One-time migration for stale agent.runtimeConfig fields (issue #194 follow-up).
//
// Background: between commits a25fc537 (Apr 15) — which added a useEffect that
// reads `runtimeConfig.model` on runtime transitions — and 8020803e (May 2,
// shipped in v0.2.15) — which started correctly writing external-runtime
// model to `runtimeConfig.model` — a latent bug got activated: switching
// runtime (historically Gemini → Codex) leaked the previous runtime's model into the new
// runtime's session, and Codex CLI rejects mismatched models with
// `"The 'gemini-3.1-pro-preview' model is not supported when using Codex
//   with a ChatGPT account"`.
//
// The write-time fix (`buildRuntimeChangePatch`) prevents new occurrences.
// This migration cleans existing damage in users' config.json so they
// don't have to manually switch runtime twice to self-heal.
//
// Strategy: for each agent where `runtime != 'builtin'` and `runtimeConfig.model`
// (or permissionMode / additionalArgs) exists, check whether the persisted
// values *look* runtime-appropriate via a conservative prefix heuristic. If
// they don't, scrub the offending fields. `envPolicy` is always preserved
// (runtime-agnostic).
//
// One-time guard: agents with `_runtimeConfigScrubV1: true` are skipped. The
// marker is set after a successful scan regardless of whether anything was
// actually changed, so we don't repeat the work every boot.
//
// **Why the heuristic is acceptable here (vs. the render path):** this runs
// exactly once per agent across the app's lifetime. False-positives just mean
// the user re-picks a model they had set; that's a one-time inconvenience.
// False-negatives leave the stale value in place, but the runtime-switch
// helper now scrubs on the next user-initiated switch. The render path
// avoided this heuristic because it would have fired on every Tab open and
// risk invalidating future Codex models with unconventional names — a
// migration doesn't have that property.
